# MeetWhiz Monetization Strategy

MeetWhiz is designed with a multi-layered monetization strategy to cater to different user segments, from small teams to large enterprises. The model is built around a core SaaS offering, amplified by a freemium engine (the coin economy) and direct revenue streams (in-app purchases).

## 1. Core SaaS Subscriptions

This is the foundational revenue stream, based on recurring monthly or annual payments.

### Tiers

-   **Free Tier**:
    -   **Target Audience**: Individuals, small community groups, or teams wanting to try the service.
    -   **Features**:
        -   1 connected WhatsApp group.
        -   Up to 5 recorded meetings per month.
        -   Basic meeting summaries.
        -   Task tracking for members.
        -   Ability to earn coins.
    -   **Limitations**: No access to the Creator Studio or Live Meeting Scribe.

-   **Pro Tier ($20/month per Admin)**:
    -   **Target Audience**: SMEs, project teams, and professional coaches.
    -   **Features**:
        -   Up to 5 connected WhatsApp groups.
        -   Unlimited recorded meetings.
        -   Full access to the **Live Meeting Scribe**.
        -   Full access to the **AI Creator Studio** (image/video generation, etc.).
        -   Advanced analytics on the dashboard.
        -   Priority support.

-   **Enterprise Tier (Custom Pricing)**:
    -   **Target Audience**: Large organizations requiring custom solutions.
    -   **Features**:
        -   Unlimited groups.
        -   White-labeling and custom branding.
        -   API access for custom integrations.
        -   Dedicated account manager and SLAs.
        -   Onboarding and training for teams.

## 2. The Freemium Engine: Coin Economy

The coin system is designed to drive engagement and act as a powerful conversion tool from the Free to the Pro tier.

### How it Works

1.  **Earning**: Users on all tiers can earn coins for completing productive actions (e.g., completing tasks on time, running a successful meeting).
2.  **Spending**: Coins can be spent to unlock temporary or one-time access to Pro features.
    -   *Example*: A Free Tier user earns 300 coins. They can spend them to use the "Generate Video" feature for a single project without subscribing.
3.  **Conversion**: After experiencing the power of a Pro feature, the user (and their Admin) is highly motivated to upgrade to the Pro Tier for unlimited access. It serves as a "try before you buy" mechanism that users earn their way into.

## 3. In-App Purchases (IAP)

This provides a direct, non-recurring revenue stream and caters to users who need immediate access to features.

### Offerings

-   **Coin Packs**: Users can purchase packs of coins with real money. For example:
    -   100 Coins - $1.99
    -   500 Coins - $8.99
    -   1000 Coins - $15.99
-   **Use Case**: An Admin on the Pro plan needs to generate a large batch of images for a campaign and has run out of their monthly quota (if applicable), or a Free user wants to generate a video immediately without waiting to earn the required coins.

## Summary of the Funnel

1.  **Acquisition**: Users join via the Free Tier, attracted by the core value proposition of automated meeting minutes.
2.  **Engagement**: The coin economy and gamification keep users active and engaged with the platform.
3.  **Conversion**: Users are converted to the Pro Tier after trying premium features via the coin system, or when they hit the limits of the Free Tier.
4.  **Expansion**: Direct revenue is supplemented through IAP for users who need more flexibility.
